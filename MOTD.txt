LOCKDOWN IS OVER!

The team has been working hard, and we found the issue!
Expect a bug fix update soon, it will be out within the next hour.

We will also have a version-check system added in the next update to prevent users playing on older versions.

To our moderation team, there will now moderator servers available for testing and general use.

Thank you for your patience, and we finally hit 10K users!!
